"text": "Yes so this place is a great place, sorry the best place to get Brazilian food. The best place in Berlin. I'm not Brazilian but my Brazilian friends who invited me confirmed this. I got the vegan version of the Feijoada and it was really good. Enough food to make you feel really sleepy after. The place is really small so not ideal for a big crowd but definitely worth the visit",
